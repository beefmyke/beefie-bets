                        You should choose from the list of predictions which ones to bet on. Betting on every single match provided
                        might reduce your chance of winning. This is usually the case regardless of how accurate the prediction
                        might look or seem. Always remember the first Rule of gambling: <b>GAMBLE THE AMOUNT YOU CAN AFFORD TO
                            LOSE!</b>. This means that you should endeavour to stake an amount that won't be detrimental to your
                        finances should your bet fail.
